# Doc gardening

The doc rules are in [docs/KNOWLEDGE_BASE.md](../../../docs/KNOWLEDGE_BASE.md); this is the procedure.

1. Run `npm run check:docs`. Its warnings are the first work: re-verify each stale doc, and fill or remove each template placeholder.
2. For each doc in the AGENTS.md map, compare what it claims (commands, paths, names, rules, the code map in ARCHITECTURE.md) with the code.
   - The doc is wrong and the code is right: fix the doc and set `last-verified` to today's UTC date.
   - The code looks wrong: add a row to the [tech-debt tracker](../../../docs/exec-plans/tech-debt-tracker.md). A gardening pass doesn't change behavior.
   - The doc can't be fixed now: set its status to `stub` so nobody relies on it.
3. If the repo has a verification skill (`.agents/skills/verify-*/`), drive every feature in its map once, following its Launch, Doctor and Cleanup sections.
   - The map or the harness is wrong and the app is right: fix the skill, and drive that feature again before calling it fixed.
   - The app is wrong: open an issue or add a tech-debt row. Product code stays as it is in this pass.
   - A feature can't be reached: record the missing precondition and the route tried in the feature's Gotchas.
4. Check that the instructions still earn their place. AGENTS.md stays under 100 lines. Remove rules that no longer prevent a real mistake, workarounds for an older model's limits, checks that fire mostly on good code, and skills or hooks nobody uses.
5. Move finished exec plans to `docs/exec-plans/completed/`, and delete tech-debt rows that are paid off.
6. Run `npm run verify`. Open one PR per area, titled `docs(<area>): <summary>`.
